What does the program do:

Program will calculate area of 3 shapes, rectangle, circle and triangle with random inputs varying from 0 - LIMIT(default 100).
AreaCalculator class' main method creates a list of above shapes, one each 
and calculates area for each shape following Visitor pattern and using AreaVisitor class.


Assumptions:
- Unit tests are written for all the supporting classes except the consumer as the consumer in iteself is a test.
- To keep it simple, except for JUnit not other 3rd party library have been used. 
- Logging, spring, maven, etc support can be added if the need be for the sake of simplicity has been avoided.
- CLI option could have been provided to take input for shapes and random input but again to not over engineer things, simple solution is implemented.

IDE used Eclipse.
